## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
time --> O((n+n)^n)becase we loop2 times in the first loop 
space --> O(n) 
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
input --> graph , arr 
output --> booleat , string (cost)
